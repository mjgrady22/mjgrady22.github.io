  <ul>
      <li> Located in coastal southwest Italy
      <li> Pompeii as we can see it now symbolized the Roman Empire at its height
      <li> The people of Pompeii didn't know that Mount Vesuvius was a volcano
      <li> Researchers believe that the town was founded in the seventh or sixth century BC by the Osci or Oscans
      <li> Pompeii became a Roman colony after they joined an unsuccessful rebellion against the Roman Republic and were conquered
      <li> Evidence for the destruction originally came from a surviving letter by Pliny the Younger
      <li> "'Darkness fell, not the dark of a moonless or cloudy night, but as if the lamp had been put out in a dark room,' wrote <br>
        Pliny the Younger, who witnessed the cataclysm from across the Bay of Naples" (Owens).
      <li> The site was lost for about 1,600 years until its initial rediscovery in 1709
      <li> Today it has UNESCO World Heritage Site status
      <li> Pompeii played a major role in the neo-classical revival of the 18th century
